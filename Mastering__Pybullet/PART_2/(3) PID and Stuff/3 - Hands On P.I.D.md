PID is perhaps the most important,popular and simplistic **feed back controller**,out there.The significance of which could be done justice only by the videos below and *not even us !!*

## Task for the part
Hope,you have gone through the above content about **PID** well, as far as this task goes, in a nutshell we implement a _PD controller_.So,most of you might have a intutive understanding about PID for now.

Hence, the essential components will be
1. **A target point**- such that the error is 0 when setpoint == targetpoint
2. **A Sensor**- to find the current _setpoint_.
3.**Actuators/Motors:** - to actually apply a action and try decrease the error.

Thus,in this task we will try implementing a PD controller to control the turning motion of the car about a constrained axis so as to fix a target box in the centre of the camera frame.It could be better understood from the illustrations below.

</p>

Thus,in our case.
1. **A target point**- is to align the camera frame centre with that of the centre of the box(ie the contour you will be detecting)
2. **A Sensor**- is the camera,which gives you the current set point ie how much deviated from the current alignment.
3. **Actuators/Motors:** - is the motors of the car,that makes the car align.

Hence the error can be easily calculated as,

<div align = "center">
   error = current x co-ordinate of target contour detected - center x cordinate of the camera frame 
</div>

**Key Points to note:**
1. We have constrained the car to only rotoate about the **z-axis**,thus no translation motion will happen.Only **clockwise and anticlockwise motion rotation** is allowed dependeing on the relative rotation of *left and right set of wheels*.

2. We recomend using **openCV** for contour detection and **cv2.moments** method to find the x cordinate of the contour.
For the ones **who are not familiar with openCV can contact use for the boilerplate code as th main motive here is to build the controller**.

3. The starter code [pid_control_starter.py](https://github.com/NiranthS/Robo-Summer-Camp-20/blob/master/Part3/Subpart3/pid_control_starter.py), has the necessary structure for the code,with the following user inputs alredy implemented,
   1. **right arrow**- anti clockwise rotation about z axis,essentially to give a initial disturbance and switch on PID to correct the alignment.
   2. **left arrow** - clockwise rotation about z axis,,essentially to give a initial disturbance and switch on PID to correct the alignment.
   3. **c key**      - to start PID control
   4. **r key**      - to stop PID control and go back to manual control to cause a error.
4.Thus,you are expected 
   1. to get a image frame like in *subpart-1, of Part 3*
   2. detect the contour, find moments.
   3. calculate the error and use PID to align your car back from the **initial user created disturbance** when _the key c_ is pressed.

5.Its worthy to highlight that for the given task, a **PD controller** is enough.Meaning we wont need any _integral term_ as ther is no error that is getting accumulated in our case. So,it enough if you PD update has only P and D terms.
