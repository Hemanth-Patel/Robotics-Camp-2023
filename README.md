# Robotics-Camp-2023

Hello all !! Are you ready to embark on an extraordinary learning journey this summer? ü•µ

Join us this summer for an extraordinary experience like no other. The Robotics Club IIT BHU is proud to present its highly anticipated Summer Camp, where young minds will be nurtured, skills will be honed, and creativity will soar to new heights.

In two dynamic phases, we will take you on a thrilling ride through the fascinating world of robotics. 

üêô Phase 1, spanning for about three weeks, will lay the foundation for your technical prowess of Pybullet (a beginner-friendly simulator) and ROS (helps researchers and developers build and reuse code between robotics applications along with various path localization and mapping techniques) . You will delve into there fundamental concepts, learn about cutting-edge technologies, and engage in hands-on activities that will ignite your passion for robotics .

ü§ñ Phase 2, an equally enthralling three-week journey, will build upon the knowledge gained in the first phase along with implementation of SolidWorks: Comprehensive Design and Assembly Techniques along with concepts of Deep Learning . Here, you will delve deeper into advanced robotics, explore intricate design techniques, and tackle exciting challenges that push the boundaries of your imagination.

üéØ But that's not all! On completion of the two phases, you will have the opportunity to work on an exhilarating project, where you can apply all that you have learned throughout the camp. Collaborate with fellow enthusiasts, brainstorm innovative ideas, and develop your innovation with the hardware accessories under the guidance of our esteemed mentors.
